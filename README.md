# A_N_D_Major_project_Credit_Card_fraud_Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the A_N_D Major Project on Credit Card Fraud Detection by P.Navaneeth.

## Project Description

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both financial institutions and cardholders. This project aims to develop a robust fraud detection system using machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions accurately and efficiently.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **notebooks/**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **src/**: This directory contains the source code for the fraud detection model.
- **reports/**: This directory contains reports, presentations, and documentation related to the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Navaneeth984/A_N_D_Major_project_Credit_Card_fraud_Detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd A_N_D_Major_project_Credit_Card_fraud_Detection
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.

5. Run the scripts in the `src/` directory to train the fraud detection model or perform inference on new data.
